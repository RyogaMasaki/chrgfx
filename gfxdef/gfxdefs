# four bits of 'bright' component
# From MAME:
# from my understanding of the schematics, when the 'brightness'
# component is set to 0 it should reduce brightness to 1/3
# Not sure how to deal with that here yet, so for now we just ignore it...
# (it seems to be used mostly for fade in/out, and during regular gameplay
# it's full brightness anyway. Anecdotally, anyway.)
